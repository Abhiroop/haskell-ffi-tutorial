# Haskell FFI Tutorial

This is a demo repository to help out with Haskell FFI, namely, with
nested structures. Everything I've found on the subject up till that 
point contained only partial information for what I've needed, 
so I decided to compose a complete tutorial together.

# Covered subjects 

You'll learn how to:

  * (expressively) represent C `struct` in Haskell code
  * call C code from Haskell
  * call Haskell code from C
  * operate on nested `struct`s 
  * operate on `struct` arrays
  * decode `unions` 
  * read and write C fixed-length strings and Pointer-type Strings

## Minimum "Viable" setup
