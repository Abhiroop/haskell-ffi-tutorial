# Haskell FFI Tutorial

This is a demo repository to help out with Haskell FFI, namely, with
nested structures. Everything I've found on the subject up till that 
point contained only partial information for what I've needed, 
so I decided to compose a complete tutorial together.

# Covered subjects 

  * how to (expressively) represent C `struct` in Haskell code
  * how to call C code from Haskell
  * how to call Haskell code from C
  * how to operate on nested `struct`s 
  * how to operate on `struct` arrays
